        <h1>Understanding <br>feelings of stress</h1>
        <p>Stress is a common response to the demands and pressures of everyday life. It’s the body’s way of reacting to challenges, changes, and potential threats. When you encounter a stressful situation, your body releases hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, which prepare you to deal with the issue—this is known as the "fight or flight" response.</p>

   <div class="para">
    <p>Feeling stressed at times is normal and, in the right amounts, can help you focus and achieve your goals. Stress is a common and helpful reaction to unfamiliar, unexpected or challenging situations. It also kicks in when you’re feeling scared or threatened. <br><br>

        When you experience something stressful, you will likely feel a strong physical reaction such as tight muscles, sweating, and increased heart rate. Or you may feel nervous, alert, or restless. These reactions are part of the ‘fight, flight or freeze’ response. This is a survival instinct to keep you alert and help you confront the challenge, escape it, or hide until it goes away.<br><br>
        
        It’s natural for your stress to increase when you have a lot on your plate. But when stress gets too high or lasts too long it becomes less helpful, and you can begin to feel overwhelmed.

        <h1>What causes stress</h1>
        <p>Everyone experiences stress in response to different things. Something that may be very stressful for one person may not affect someone else at all. But there are situations that are stressful for most people, including:
            <br>
           <ul> 
            <li>major life events, such as death of a loved one, moving house, or changing your school or job</li>
          <li>  health issues, such as being diagnosed or living with an illness or caring for someone</li>
            <li>financial problems, such as being in debt or needing to work overtime to make ends meet</li>
            <li>relationship or family difficulties, such as a break-up, an argument, or abuse.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
            <p>Even positive changes can be stressful. For example, you might be excited about a promotion at work, or getting into the sporting finals, and feel stressed about doing well at the same time.

    <h1>When does stress become a problem?
    </h1>
    <p id="p">Stress is healthy when it is short-lived, and it helps to get you through challenges. Some people even rely or thrive on stress to get things done. But when it is not managed effectively, or you are in a stressful situation for a long time, stress can affect your mental and physical health and wellbeing. This could range from burnout or fatigue to serious heart conditions.<br>

        <br>You should consider taking extra steps if you often feel:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>more stressed than usual</li>
            <li>overwhelmed or that you have little control</li>
                <li>tired and drained most of the time</li>
                    <li>forgetful or have difficulty focusing</li>
                        <li>irritable or frustrated.</li>
                            </ul>

        <h1>Understanding <br>feelings of anger</h1>
        <p>Anger is a natural and often intense emotional response to perceived threats, injustice, or frustration. It's a complex emotion that can vary in intensity from mild irritation to full-blown rage. Anger typically involves physiological changes such as increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, and adrenaline release, preparing the body for action.</p>

    <p>Everyone gets angry from time to time. Your feelings of anger could vary from mild irritation or frustration with day-to-day hassles, to more intense moments of rage. When you’re angry, you might feel tense or shaky, your heart will likely beat faster, and you may want to say or do things you wouldn’t normally do. These are all normal things to experience and aren’t a problem if you can manage them effectively.

        Like all your emotions, anger has an important role in your life. It can help you to stand up for yourself and the things you care about, often motivating and energising you to take action. Being aware of when you’re angry and understanding what’s causing it will help you to act on it in a productive way.

        <h1>What causes anger</h1>
        <p>Anger is a natural response to when you feel certain expectations, desires or values aren’t being met. These could be expectations of how you think something should work, how someone should behave, or even how you see yourself.
            <br>
            <p>Often, anger is just the outward expression of other emotions, including:
            </p>
           <ul> 
            <li>anxiety or fear</li>
          <li>  tiredness </li>
            <li>stress due to school, work, family, health or money</li>
            <li>feeling like you have no control</li>
            <li>feeling misunderstood or blamed</li>
            <li>feelings of rejection, embarrassment, shame or guilt.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
            <p>Over time, emotions and minor annoyances can build up and reach a breaking point. When you feel threatened or powerless, anger can help you feel strong and protected in the moment.

    <h1>When does anger become a problem?
    </h1>
    <p id="p">Experiencing anger isn’t something to be concerned about; it can even be a motivating force to solve problems and achieve your goals. When you express your anger in unsafe ways that hurt you, or people around you, it starts to become a problem. If not managed effectively, anger can cause problems in your friendships and family, or work, legal troubles, and other long-term mental and physical health issues.

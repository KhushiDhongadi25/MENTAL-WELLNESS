        <h1>Understanding <br>feelings of worry <br>and anxiety</h1>
        <p>Worry and anxiety are natural responses to stress and uncertain situations. Worry often involves repetitive thoughts about potential problems or dangers, while anxiety can manifest as a more intense, often physical, response to stress. It’s normal to feel worried or anxious from time to time, especially when facing significant life changes, challenges, or unknowns. </p>

    <p>Everyone worries about things that are important to them such as money, health, family, work; it’s a normal part of life. Feeling worried or anxious is a common response to a stressful situation. 

        Anxiety is your brain and body’s response to an actual or potential threat. When you feel threatened, you may start breathing faster and your heart rate may increase. Your muscles may become tense, or you may feel shaky. Your skin may get flushed or very pale, your pupils may dilate, and your mouth may go dry. You can be on high alert or agitated, and may feel like you need to leave the place you're in.
        
        All these are your brain and body’s way of preparing you to deal with the threat by confronting the challenge, running to escape it, or freezing to hide from it — known as the ‘fight, flight or freeze’ response.

        <h1>What causes worry and anxiety</h1>
        <p>Feeling anxious or worried every now and then is normal. It is also common for these feelings to increase when there are other things impacting your wellbeing, including:<br>
           <ul> 
            <li>not getting enough sleep, nutrition, or exercise </li>
          <li>  your life being out of balance — for example, when work or school demands are high, with less chance to do things you enjoy such as hobbies, exercise, daily routines </li>
            <li>dealing with illness that someone you care about or you are going through</li>
            <li>managing uncertainty due to difficulties with finances, housing, or relationships </li>
            <li>dealing with lots of change or new situations.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
            <p>How much you worry is partly related to genetics and personality, and partly to your experiences and beliefs. For example, if you believe worrying about a person or situation is helpful, you will likely spend more time worrying, which isn’t helpful.

    <h1>When does worry or anxiety become a problem?</h1>
    <p id="p">Worry can initially draw our attention to a situation we might need to address. Sometimes it can leave us feeling unsure about what to do, and this can lead to anxiety. That isn't always a bad thing; more mild levels of worry and anxiety can be helpful. For example, feeling anxious about an upcoming exam or a job interview can help motivate you to prepare more thoroughly.<br>

        But sometimes we can get stuck in cycles of worry, or the fight, flight or freeze response gets triggered when it doesn’t need to be. If this becomes a pattern, it can start to be a problem. <br>

        <br>A few signs that you may need to consider taking extra steps include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>constantly feeling restless or on edge</li>
            <li>regularly experiencing physical symptoms of anxiety such as rapid heartbeat, trembling, difficulty breathing, or nausea</li>
                <li>having headaches, muscle aches, or unexplained pains</li>
                    <li>having sleep problems such as sleeping too much or having trouble falling asleep</li>
                        <li>spending lots of time worrying, which can sometimes feel like endless worries going round and round in your head, with no answers</li>
                            <li>going out of your way to avoid situations that you think could make you anxious or worried.</li>
        </ul>

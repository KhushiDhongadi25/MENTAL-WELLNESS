        <h1>Understanding <br>feelings of loneliness</h1>
        <p>Feeling lonely is something everyone experiences from time to time. It's that sense of being alone or isolated, even when you're surrounded by people. Loneliness isn't just about being physically alone; it's more about feeling disconnected or not having meaningful social connections. It's important to recognize that loneliness is a natural feeling and it's okay to feel this way. </p>

    <p>You've probably felt lonely or isolated at different points in your life. Feelings of loneliness are personal and affect everyone differently. Some people can spend a lot of time by themselves without feeling lonely. Others may find it challenging to be alone even for a short time.

        When you’re lonely, you may find that you feel alone even when you’re with friends or groups of people. You may feel like no one understands you. You may start avoiding social events because the thought of spending time with people exhausts you. You might feel down or worthless, start spending more time on social media, or notice that some unhealthy habits have increased. There are things you can do to overcome these feelings before it becomes a chronic issue.

        <h1>What causes loneliness</h1>
        <p>Loneliness is a response to social and environmental triggers. Some people describe loneliness as the feeling they have when they can’t meet their need for social contact and relationships. <br>

            Loneliness or isolation can be influenced by something going on in your life, especially if there have been some big changes, such as:<br>
           <ul> 
            <li>losing a loved one</li>
          <li>  going through a breakup, separation or divorce</li>
            <li>moving out of home for the first time</li>
            <li>switching schools or jobs, retiring from work, or losing your job</li>
            <li>becoming a parent for the first time</li>
            <li>moving to a new place where you don’t have family, friends or community</li>
            <li>experiencing language or cultural barriers in your community.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
            <p>Other reasons you might feel lonely or isolated include being stressed about something, being bullied, having a physical disability, going through depression or anxiety, and having a chronic illness. You can also feel extra lonely at certain times of the year such as Christmas, Valentine’s Day, and other occasions where people usually get together with loved ones. Whatever the cause, loneliness is a very personal experience. </p>

    <h1>When does loneliness become a problem?</h1>
    <p id="p">Feeling lonely or isolated isn’t always a sign of something more serious. If you’ve experienced a change or event that caused these feelings—such as losing someone or ending a relationship—they will often go away or improve once you’ve had time to adapt to your new situation. But if you've been feeling lonely and isolated for a long time, or it’s started impacting your daily life and how you function, it can be a problem. <br>

        <br>A few signs that you may need to seek support are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>experiencing physical symptoms such as headaches, feeling ill or tired, or having unexplained pains</li>
            <li>having panic attacks, feeling anxious or paranoid</li>
                <li>feeling constantly exhausted and lacking motivation to do anything</li>
                    <li>having sleep problems such as sleeping too much or having trouble falling asleep</li>
                        <li>putting on weight, losing weight, or losing your appetite</li>
                            <li>having negative thoughts about yourself and feeling like you don’t have any confidence</li>
                                <li>feeling negative about the future</li>
                                    <li>drinking lots of alcohol, misusing medication, or taking drugs</li>
                                        <li>withdrawing from the important people in your life.</li>
        </ul>
